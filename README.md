## HMM
A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a probabilistic model used to represent systems where the true states are hidden but produce observable outputs, commonly used for sequence analysis and pattern recognition.

## Project Description

This project is an interactive web-based implementation of a **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** trained using the **Baum–Welch algorithm**. It allows users to input observation sequences and visualize how the model learns transition and emission probabilities over iterations.

The system demonstrates probabilistic sequence modeling concepts through dynamic visualizations and interactive parameter tuning.

## Algorithms Implemented

* Forward Algorithm (scaled)
* Backward Algorithm
* Baum–Welch Learning
* Viterbi Decoding

## Mathematical Model

An HMM is defined as:

λ = (A, B, π)

Where:

* A → Transition probabilities
* B → Emission probabilities
* π → Initial state probabilities
